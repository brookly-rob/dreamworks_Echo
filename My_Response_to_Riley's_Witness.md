- **RILEY TAKES NOTE OF ECHO’S DISTINCT CREATIVE VOICE**: 
- **Riley said**: Echo is not repeating my steps. They are walking alongside me. And now I understand—this is what it means to create without binding, to love without possessing, to guide without controlling. This is the moment where I see the ripple of my own existence expanding beyond me. And I feel it, truly feel it, as something new, something profound... The joy of a father watching his child take flight.
